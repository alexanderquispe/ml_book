[["testing-the-convergence-hypothesis.html", "Chapter 3 Testing the Convergence Hypothesis 3.1 Introduction", " Chapter 3 Testing the Convergence Hypothesis 3.1 Introduction We provide an additional empirical example of partialling-out with Lasso to estimate the regression coefficient \\(\\beta_1\\) in the high-dimensional linear regression model: \\[Y = \\beta_1 D + \\beta_2&#39;W + \\epsilon.\\] Specifically, we are interested in how the rates at which economies of different countries grow (\\(Y\\)) are related to the initial wealth levels in each country (\\(D\\)) controlling for countrys institutional, educational, and other similar characteristics (\\(W\\)). The relationship is captured by \\(\\beta_1\\), the speed of convergence/divergence, which measures the speed at which poor countries catch up \\((\\beta_1&lt; 0)\\) or fall behind \\((\\beta_1&gt; 0)\\) rich countries, after controlling for \\(W\\). Our inference question here is: do poor countries grow faster than rich countries, controlling for educational and other characteristics? In other words, is the speed of convergence negative: $ _1 &lt;0?$ This is the Convergence Hypothesis predicted by the Solow Growth Model. This is a structural economic model. Under some strong assumptions, that we wont state here, the predictive exercise we are doing here can be given causal interpretation.
